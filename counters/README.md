# CS50, Lab 3, 21S - counters module
## Ted Northup

This module is a counters module, which has a counter variable keeping track of the numeber of items (but not the
items themselves) under each key. 

I approached this implementation through a linked list, adding countersnodes with given keys by linking them
to previous nodes in the counter set.
