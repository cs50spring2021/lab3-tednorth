#CS50, Lab 3, 21S -- hashtable module
## Ted Northup

This module was a hashtable module, which is a set of slots which make accessing large amounts of data easier. We 
choose the number of slots.

I implemented this module through a set at each slot. In each set, we would add set nodes for a key, item pair 
designated in a linked list fashion.
